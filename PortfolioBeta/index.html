								<h2>Project Brief</h2>
							</header>
							<h3><strong>Objective</strong></h3>
							<p>Allow anyone to shop, transfer money, and more without a debit or credit card or the need to visit a physical bank or store.</p>
							<h3><strong>Context</strong></h3>
							<p>The world of buying and selling has changed—more and more transactions happen online without the need for a physical credit or debit card. The amount of online sales and transactions is and has been steadily increasing, consumers are subscribing to a multitude of online services, and high street stores are closing in large numbers.<br>
								<br>
								There are many factors that make online purchases favorable, from cost and convenience, to security, to name but a few. This ecommerce trend has been catalyzed by the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020, forcing many people to stay inside, wary of going to the store and of using their physical cards to pay for items.<br>
								<br>
								With it, this trend has brought forward the problem of how to make purchases securely and efficiently. How can your banking and card details be stored in one place? How can this same tool be used to make transactions or transfers in online stores and overseas? What’s important to users when buying online?</p>

						<p><strong>Security:</strong> Some users will feel like there is a possibility that their account will get hacked and someone else will have access to their banking information</p>
						<p><strong>International Purchases:</strong> Making purchases overseas, users could be skeptical of the reliability and security of certain stores.</p>
						<p><strong>Organization:</strong> For users that have a plethora of different credit and debit cards, they may want a feature that allows them to store all of their cards in an organized and efficient manner.</p>
						<p><strong>Budgeting:</strong> It is easy for some users to get caught up in online shopping and spend more than they anticipated. These people would like to reduce their amount of monthly excess spending.</p>

							<h2><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h2>

						<p>Our PlutoPay app users need a way to quickly and effectively transfer money to different accounts, use that money to buy their favorite products online, and budget their monthly income. Most importantly, our users should feel safe and secured while managing their account.
	
							We will know this to be true when we see that people are consistently using the app and making transactions that they would normally do in person. Our retention rate should stay high because users are interested in what is offered.</p>
