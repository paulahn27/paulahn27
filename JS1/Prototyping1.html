            /* The basic calendar is copied from here https://medium.com/@nitinpatel_20236/challenge-of-building-a-calendar-with-pure-javascript-a86f1303267d with some modifications and comments. The author commented the code using // single line markers, so I'll add my own comments in comment blocks with slash-asterisks.

            Javascript is denoted with the script block and can be placed either in the head or the body. I tend to either put it all in the head or all at the bottom of the body (or actually put it in a separate file named whatever.js and link to it like you'd link a stylesheet). Note: It's safe to declare variables and define functions within the head, but any functions that you invoke within the script block will execute as the page is loaded, so if it's in the head tag and the function tries to manipulate stuff in the body, it might not work since technically the stuff in the body doesn't yet exist.

            There's a few ways to declare variables in JS. It used to be you would use the word "var" then the variable name to tell the script that you want to create a new variable, but, more recently, "let" was introduced to help developers scope their variables, and there's, as far as I can tell, very few cases where you'd want to use var instead of let now.
            
            So the next few lines define some variables for the script to use. Variables are like addresses or labels you want to use to name bits of information you want the script to remember. In the first case, we're creating the label "today" and then assigning it a value of today's date. The words "new Date()" is telling the script to run a built-in function that returns the current date. It's like asking "What's today's date?" and it "returns" or responds with today's current date.
            
            The other variables are other built-in functions that are based off the date. "today.getMonth()" for example runs the function "getMonth()" on the variable that we set with "today." Since we just set today to the current date, the getMonth function can tell us the current month. */
            let today = new Date();
            let currentMonth = today.getMonth();
            let currentYear = today.getFullYear();

            /* The variable "months" here is being set to what's called an "array." It's like taking a group of data and clumping them together and giving them one name, sort of like how the variable "The Beatles" references John, Paul, George, and Ringo. What's neat about arrays is that the variable also remembers which order you put the items in, so you can later refer to specific items in the array by position. */
            let months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];

            /* The monthAndYear variable next is using Javascript's way of identifying an HTML element (aka tag) by referencing whatever CSS id you've given a particular element. This identification then lets you manipulate the text within the tag. In other words, if you look through the HTML, you'll eventually find something with the id "monthAndYear." Whatever HTML element has that id will get returned by the "getElementById("monthAndYear") function and then stored in a variable also called "monthAndYear." In this case, it's a h3 tag that we're using as the label for the calendar. The word "document" is sort of like a built-in variable that references the current HTML page you're working on. */
            let monthAndYear = document.getElementById("monthAndYear");

            let whatDay = document.getElementById("whatDay");
            
            /* The next line tells the script that you're going to define a function or a command you want it to execute whenever you invoke the keyword or name that you're giving the function. In this case, we're giving the function the name "showCalendar." The "(month, year)" part tells the script to expect us to provide those two bits of info when we tell it to execute showCalendar. */
            function showCalendar(month, year) {

                /* Here's some variables being defined within the function, which limits their scope to just the function. If we were create another function and ask it to manipulate one of these variables, it'd return an error since that'd be outside of this specific function. Generally, you want to limit variables so they don't eat up memory. It's prob not that big of a deal unless you're doing something really complicated or the user has multiple tabs and other apps open, though. */
                /* This variable sets a variable to a number, depending on what day it is. We'll use this later to check whether the cells in the calendar table should be blank in case the first day of the month isn't a Sunday. */

                /* I threw in this line just to make it clear what's going on with the firstDay variable. Go look at how this page renders in a browser window! */
                whatDay.innerHTML = "The first day of this month starts after " + firstDay + " spaces.";
                /* According to the website where this code was grabbed (see top of this script block), the author had to do some math to figure out how many days are in any given month because there's no built-in function for that. That's why you see 32 - x. */
                let daysInMonth = 32 - new Date(year, month, 32).getDate();

                /* This one is important. It creates a variable named "tbl" and assigns to it the element that contains the id "calendar-body," which if you look at the above code you can see is the main section of the table that started as HTML with a row of table headers. We'll use this to create the calendar table when this showCalendar function is executed. */
                let tbl = document.getElementById("calendar-body"); // body of the calendar

                // clearing all previous cells
                /* This probably isn't needed, but there in the example that this code is grabbed from, you could use a dropdown list to change which month and year you're looking at and the table would update dynamically. I stripped that code out to make this example simpler... */
                tbl.innerHTML = "";

                // filling data about month and year in the page via DOM.
                /* DOM refers to "document object model" and refers to the structure or way the HTML has to be formatted and how things are nested within each other for the page to render in some standard way. It includes all the various elements (and the hierarchies for their nestings) and default variables or settings of the page. For example, the DOM specifies that there's only one html tag that begins and ends the whole document and that everything else needs to be in it. Likewise, td needs to be within a tr tag which in turn is within a table tag. Within the td is text that's displayed on the page. In the case below, we're setting the text of "monthAndYear" which is a h3 tag that we set earlier in this script to the current month and year. */
                monthAndYear.innerHTML = months[month] + " " + year;

                for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) { /* Here's a "for loop" that we're using to create up to 6 new rows in the table.
