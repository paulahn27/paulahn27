<h2> Neumorphism in Adobe XD</h2>
<p>Welcome to a tutorial on how to make neumorphic shapes on Adobe XD! Although it may be a difficult process, neumorphism is a great way of adding a cool 3D effect to your next UX/UI design project. In short, the basic concept behind neumorphism is to add two shadows, one with a negative value and one with a positive value, to any sized shape so that it looks like it is either coming out of the screen or going into the screen. This tutorial specifically will teach you how to make a neumorphic circle, but the same process can be applied to any shape that you make in Adobe XD.</p>

<h2 id="headers">How to create a pushed out Neumorphic circle</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Press <q>R</q> and hold <q>Shift</q> while dragging the corner of the rectangle to create a simple square. </li>
        <li>Set the border radius of the square to 100 to make it a circle.</li>
        <li>Under the <q>Appearance</q> option, add a black shadow to your circle with a X and Y coordinate of 6 and a Blur of 10.</li>
        <li>Duplicate your circle and place the new circle directly on top of the old one.</li>
        <li>Add a white shadow to the new circle with an X and Y coordinate of -6 and a Blur of 10.</li>
        <li>Adjust the opacity of the first circle’s shadow to 20%</li>
        <li>Adjust the opacity of the second circle’s shadow to 80%.</li>
        <li>If needed, alter the Blur, X and Y coordinate, and color of the circle until you are satisfied with the result.</li>
</ol>

<em>Note: Different sized shapes will require different amounts of blur and shadow opacity. Play around with these components until you find the amount that looks right to you!</em>

        <ol>
            <li>Make a circle and add a black border of size 5 under the “Appearance” option</li>
            <li>Adjust the object blur of the circle to 5 and name the circle “Dark”</li>
            <li>Duplicate the “Dark” circle and name it “Light.”</li>
            <li>Position the light circle off to the side and make the border color white and add an object blur of 5.</li>
            <li>Duplicate the dark circle again and position it off to the side. Name the circle “Mask.”</li>
            <li>Right click the mask circle and under the “Arrange” option click “Bring to Front.”</li>
            <li>Position all the elements directly on top of each other.</li>
            <li>Move the light circle more towards the top left of the other two circles</li>
            <li>Select all elements and right click to mask with shape.</li>
            <li>Adjust the Opacity, Object Blur, and Border Size of Color of all the elements until satisfied.</li>

        <em>Note: Adobe XD will try to automatically set the animation duration to 0.2 seconds. You must manually delete the .2 in order to make it 0 seconds.</em>
